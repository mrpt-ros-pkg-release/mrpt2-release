## Dependencies

Check out <a href="dependencies.html" >this page</a> to find out what are needed for each of the MRPT build dependencies (opencv, wxWidgets,...)
to decide if you need them for your applications.

## Performance benchmarks

Extensive performance tests are automated by means of the application `mrpt-performance`, which was moved (2018)
to [its own Git repository](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt-performance-tests).

The results on different platforms, as well as a comparison between different
compilers and platforms are published here: https://performance.mrpt.org/
